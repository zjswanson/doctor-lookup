# Doctor Lookup

Doctor Lookup is a simple app built to highlight the basics of asynchronous AJAX API calls.

**Doctor Lookup** will let you find medical providers in a given area that by searching their information on **BetterDoctor.com**.  But can't we already do this through **BetterDoctor's** existing (and quite polished) site?  Yes!  The real fun of **Doctor Lookup** is looking at the code under the hood.  This app implements the **BetterDoctor** API, serving as a good introductoon to using API's, parsing their returns, and building a UI.
**Doctor Lookup** is also an example of how to set up and develop a project using **Node Package Manager (NPM)** , **Bower**, and **Gulp** task runner.

## Installation

Requires **npm** and **bower** installed in order to run.

Step 1: **Clone this repository to your local computer**

```console
git clone [url]
```

Step 2: **Install all development and production dependencies from the project root directory**

```console
npm install
```
```
bower install
```
Step 3: **Note that this project requires an API key from Better Doctors to be exported from a `.env` file in the project root. To run, please obtain a free key from BetterDoctor and insert it into  `.env` as `apiKey`**

```js
exports.apiKey = "YOUR KEY HERE";
```

Step 4: **Use _gulp_ to build compile the app**

```console
gulp build
```

**Note:** You can create a minified production build of the app by adding the `--production` tag

```console
gulp build --production
```

Step 5: **Use _Browser Sync_ to run a local server instance**

```console
gulp serve
```

Step 6: **Enter whatever horrible medical affliction you suffer into the form and click `Search` to find some doctors!**


## Known Bugs

*

## Technologies Used

* This project was developed using NPM and Bower dependency managers.  The following packages are used in one or both of the development or produciton builds:
*   Gulp.js (workflow automation)
*   Browserify (manage requirements between files in app logic)
*   Gulp concat (concatenation of multiple files)
*   Gulp-uglify (Minification of files for production build)(also, saying Uglify is fun)
*   Vinyl Source Stream (Assists with paths in concatenation)
*   JS Hint (javascript linter)
*   Sass (CSS compiler)
*   Gulp Sourcemaps (used in Sass source management)
*   Bower-files (Assists in managing front end vendor dependencies)
*   Browser Sync (runs local dev server and file watchers)
*   Del (file cleanup during builds)

*   And all the usual suspects: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Atom text editor, Spotify for Dev's headphone soundtrack.
